<!-- The first task is to expand decoratemytext.html by adding UI controls. 
    Add HTML code for the following:

A field for users to enter large (multi-line) amounts of text.
It should be 4 rows by 30 columns in size.
Wrap it in a bordered field set box with the label "Text".
Add a second bordered field set box labeled "Decoration" that contains the following controls:
A button labeled: Bigger Decorations!
A checkbox labeled "Bling"
NOTE: Controls are sometimes used in forms; but you must not use the form tag on your page. -->
